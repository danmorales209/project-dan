TOO MUCH FOOD is a recipe and restaurant search site. Simply enter the name of a food item that you have too much of into our recipe search engine, and the results will be those recipes that utilize the greatest amount of that food item. Alternatively, put it all in a slow cooker to have tomorrow, and pick a restaurant tonight using our restaurant search. Bon appetit!
