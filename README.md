# Too Much Food
**TOO MUCH FOOD** is what you have and **WHERE YOU LOOK** if you got carried away at your local farmers market, at Costco, or if your neighbor (the proud gardener) gave you 20 lbs. of zucchini. Simply enter the name of the food item that you have too much of into our recipe search and the results will be those recipes that utilize the greatest amount of that food item.  Alternatively, put it all in a crock pot set for tomorrow and pick a restaurant tonight using our restaurant search.

_Bon appetit!_
